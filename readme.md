<h1>Build a Library</h1>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve become head librarian at your local Books-‘N-Stuff, which is in dire need of your help. They’re still using index cards to organize their content! Yikes.</p>

<p>But no matter, you know some JavaScript, so let’s get to work modernizing your new digs.</p>

<p>Books-‘N-Stuff carries three different types of media: books, CDs, and movies. In this project you will create a parent class named Media with three subclasses: Book, Movie, and CD.</p>
